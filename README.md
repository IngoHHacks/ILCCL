# ILCCL

Infinite Lives Custom Content Loader

Loads custom content for Infinite Lives.

## Disclaimer
This is the public beta version of the ILCCL. It's a very early version and may contain bugs. Please report any bugs in the [modding Discord](https://discord.gg/zWzRCTHMdS).

## Getting Started

### Installation
The currently recommended way to install mods is through r2modman. Since Infinite Lives hasn't yet been added to the mod manager, you will need to use a custom build. You can find the custom build [here](https://ingoh.net/r2mm-ht.zip).
Just extract the zip file and run the executable. You can then install ILCCL and other mods through the mod manager, and they will be automatically loaded when you start the game through the mod manager by selecting the "Run Modded" option.

## Documentation
ILCCL is a fork of [WECCL](https://github.com/IngoHHacks/WECCL). Most of the features are the same, but there are some differences. The documentation for WECCL can be found [here](https://ingoh.net/weccl/docs/). Once ILCCL is more stable, it will have its own documentation.

## Modding Discord

## Support Development
ILCCL is developed in my free time and I don't make any money from it. Any support is greatly appreciated and helps me continue to develop ILCCL and other mods/tools. You can donate on my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/IngoH).  
If you want to support the project in other ways, you can share ILCCL with your friends or on social media, join the modding Discord to help others, report bugs, or contribute to the codebase and documentation.
